# Team 13 Acree Memorial Hackfest for Mental Health, April 10th, 2021
# Team Members: Sam Yao
## Description
This is Team 13's project from the Acree Memorial Mental Health Hackfest 2021 at tOSU.

Prompt: To find and deliver insights on a questionnaire on the mental health of college students.

Solution: A Supervised Logistic Regression Machine Learning model that used four symptoms based on a score from 1 to 4. A prediction array gives the likelihood a subject is going to receive therapy vs the likelihood they will not.

## How to Use
This project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook, so it will require anaconda3 and Jupyter Notebook to process the script itself. However, I have included a pdf of the code, which I submitted to the Hackfest, in case Jupyter Notebook doesn't work out for you.
